Tic-Tac-Toe is a widely enjoyed two-player game, where participants alternate marking 'X'es or 'O's within a 3Ã—3 grid. It has been adapted across various platforms, from traditional pen and paper to diverse digital interfaces.

The objective is simple: the player who manages to place three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row emerges victorious.

## Key Features

#### Built-in Moves Calculation

The game engine facilitates the tracking of player moves, ensuring that each turn is accurately recorded within the grid.

#### Winner Detection

Through systematic analysis of the grid after each move, the game determines whether a player has successfully aligned three marks in a row, signaling the end of the game and declaring a winner.

#### Reset Functionality

To facilitate consecutive rounds of play, a reset option is often integrated, allowing players to clear the grid and commence a new game at their discretion.

## Development Steps
